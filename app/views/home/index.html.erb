        When we made Hyper Alerts 2, our goal was to make a great service that people would be
        willing to pay for. The least you should be able to expect from a great service is stability.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately stability is not something you can take for granted when you're working with Facebook
        or e-mail. These last months have made us realize that we can't put in the amount of resources that is
        necessary to make Hyper Alerts great, so we have decided to call it a day.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will continue to get your alerts until <em>July 11th, 2014</em>, but we urge you to find a replacement as soon as possible.
        There will be no bug fixes or support starting today. We deeply appreciate all of your enthusiasm and suggestions.
        Some of you have been especially helpful with plenty of constructive critique â€” you know who you are, and we'd
        like to take this opportunity to thank you for all of your feedback.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #e86244;">Lots of love,</span><br />
